Experiments in LLVM, probably leading to some sort of simple,
low-level Lisp language implementation.

Right now I'm working on building a small compiler that parses
Lisp expressions to do integer math only.

Eventually, it might become something like a backend for [this other
Lisp](https://github.com/eigenhombre/l1/).

For the moment, see `compiler_test.go` to get an idea of the direction.
